# Election_Analysis

### Project Overview 
### The Colorado Board of Elections asked for an analysis of the results of Colorado's first congressional district. Diana DeGette has held the seat since 1997 and won this race.  The Board wanted to know the details of this particular race. The following is what was found: 

#### - The total number of votes cast 
#### - A complete list of candidates who recieved votes
#### - The total number of votes each candidate recieved 
#### - The percenatge of the votes cast each candidate recieved 
#### - The winner of the election based on the popular vote within Colorado's 1st district 
#### - The Voter Turnout for each county 
#### - The percentage of votes from each county out of total count 
#### - The County with the highest turnout 

## Resource 
#### -Data source: Election_results.csv 
#### -Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.51

## Election-Audit Results 
#### - Total votes cast = 369,711
#### - The county with the greatest number of ballots cast was Denver, where 306,055 cast ballots. Voters cast 82.8% of the total vote volume in Denver county. Jefferson county had the second largest electorate with 38,855 ballots cast and 10.5% of the vote. Finally, Arapahoe county had 24,801 active voters in this election, with 6.7% of the vote. 
#### - Denver County had the largest turnout of voters in this election. This is likely because Denver is significantly more densley populated than both Jefferson and Arapahoe county. 
#### - Diana Degette(D), the incumbent in the race, easily won the majority of the votes. She recieved 73.8% of the vote and recieved 272,892 votes. Charles Casper Stockham(R), recieved only 23% of the vote and 85,213 votes in total. Finally, the third party candidate Raymon Anthony Doane(L) recieved 3.1% of the vote and 11,606. It should be noted that a third party candidate recieving 3% of the vote is something to note as it is unusual. 
#### - Diana Degette(D) easily won re-election with 73.8% of the vote and total of 272,892 votes.

## Election-Audit Summary:
#### This information is useful in several ways. First, we understand which counties saw better turnout for the election. Denver county did recieve the most returned ballots, but we know that Denver county does have the most dense population of the three included in the audit. This means that we can further look into what the turnout rate was per registered voter within a county. If we would like an even more accurate understanding we could count how many ballots were returned per citizen within the three counties. Why is this useful? It is useful information for the Elections commission because if we can better understand how geography is influencing not only voter turnout but also voter registraion, we can make data driven decisions about allocating resource in both get out the vote (GOTV) efforts as well as general voter registration. The Board should also use this information to understand where to expect high voter turnout. This will allow it to allocate vote counters, and other election day resources properly. 

#### While it is absolutley vital to the health of democracy that election board's remain nonpartisan, it is interesting and important to consider what else the data tells us. This district is very solidly Democratic, Degette won by a very large margin. That said, the fact that a third party candidate could pull 3% of the vote in a general election is incredibly significant. It indicates that there may be room for challengers to win a primary against the incumbent. While it is true that the third party candidate in this instence ran as a libertarian, the party that stands closer ideologically to the republican side, the fact that a significant percentage of voters chose to vote third party shows discontent with candidates seen as being part of the establishment. We can also compare our data to other successful primary challengers in the last few years. We have seen a lot of districts send more progressive candidates to washington in the last couple of elections cycles. Does our turnout and demographic breakdown look similar to those congressional districts? If we were to further examine the data for demographics, wealth and education breakdowns of the counties within the district, we could find that Degette is likely vulnerable to this kind of challenge.
